Goal

The goal of this puzzle is to use string manipulation to change a string of text to another. Doing so requires following 18 sequential directions. At the end you'll have a punny new phrase that's related to the original phrase.

Attached are 2 Jupyter Notebooks - one with the questions and one with the answers. The answers show cells containing a method that worked for me to solve that step - they aren't the most efficient or pythonic. In addition, I tried several types of solutions so they aren't even consistent. But they work and are useful to check your answers against.
